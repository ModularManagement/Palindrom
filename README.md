PuppetJs
========

Library for two-way data binding between local JSON view models and remote, using JSON-Patch, w/ optional OT, via HTTP or WebSockets.
 

Implements [Server communication](https://github.com/Starcounter-Jack/PuppetJs/wiki/Server-communication).

For additional binding with DOM, browser history, etc. use [PuppetDOM](#PuppetDOM).

### Installation

You can install it using [bower](http://bower.io/) `bower install PuppetJs` or just download from [github](https://github.com/PuppetJs/PuppetJs).

Then add source to your head:

```html

<!-- include PuppetJs with dependencies -->
<script src="bower_components/fast-json-patch/src/json-patch-duplex.js"></script>
<script src="bower_components/PuppetJs/src/puppet.js"></script>
```

### Usage

After DOM is ready, initialize with the constructor:

```javascript
/**
 * Defines a connection to a remote PATCH server, gives an object that is persistent between browser and server
 */
var puppet = new Puppet();
// ..
// use puppet.obj
puppet.obj.someProperty = "new value";
```

### Demo

[Example of PuppetJS + PuppetDOM with Polymer's Template Binding and Web Components](http://puppetjs.github.io/PuppetJs/lab/polymer/index.html)

### Options (Constructor parameters)
All the parameters are optional.
```javascript
var puppet = new Puppet({attribute: value});
```

`onPatchSent`         | *Function* |                        | See above


### Binding object once is ready (`callback`)
To bind object where you need once it will be fetched from remote you can use define `callback` in constructor:
```javascript
var puppet = new Puppet({callback: function (obj) {
  document.getElementById('test').model = obj;
}});
```

### Sending client changes to remote

PuppetJs detects changes to the observed object in real time. So after
```javascript
puppet.obj.some="change";
```
The JSON Patch request will be send to the remote.

### Ignoring local changes (`ignoreAdd`)

If you want to create a property in the observed object that will remain local, there is an `ignoreAdd` option and property that
let's you disregard client-side "add" operations in the object using a regular expression. Sample usage:

```javascript
// in constructor
var puppet = new Puppet({obj: myObj, ignoreAdd: /\/_.+/});
// or via property
puppet.ignoreAdd = null;  //undefined or null means that all properties added on client will be sent to server
puppet.ignoreAdd = /./; //ignore all the "add" operations
puppet.ignoreAdd = /\/\$.+/; //ignore the "add" operations of properties that start with $
puppet.ignoreAdd = /\/_.+/; //ignore the "add" operations of properties that start with _
// .. later on any
myObj._somethingNew = 1; // will not be propagated to server
```

### Upgrading to WebSocket (`useWebSocket`)

You can upgrade the communication protocol to use WebSocket by setting `useWebSocket: true` option in Puppet constructor or you can switch it at any moment by `puppet.useWebSocket = true`.

WebSocket is a replacement for requests that would be sent using `HTTP PATCH` otherwise. The requests sent over `HTTP GET` (such as link clicks) are not affected.

:bulb: Note that this is an experimental implementation in which the WebSocket upgrade request URL is hardcoded (`__default/wsupgrade/<sessionID>`). In future, it will be replaced with a configurable URL.

Sample:

```javascript
// enable it in constructor
var puppet = new Puppet({useWebSocket: true});
// change it later via property
puppet.useWebSocket = false;
```

### Dependencies

PuppetJs is dependent on [Starcounter-Jack/JSON-Patch](https://github.com/Starcounter-Jack/JSON-Patch) to observe changes in local scope, generate patches to be sent to the server and apply changes received from the server.

### Development

In order to minify it locally you'll need a basic setup.

* Install [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/):

    ```sh
    $ [sudo] npm install -g grunt-cli
    ```

* Install local dependencies:

    ```sh
    $ npm install
    ```

* To minify project.

    ```sh
    $ grunt uglify
    ```

### Releases

To release new version run
```sh
grunt uglify bump

```

### Testing

Open `test/SpecRunner.html` in your web browser to run Jasmine test suite.

PuppetDOM
========

Extension to [PuppetJS](#PuppetJS) that adds DOM into two-way data binding chain (DOM ↔ local JSON ↔ remote JSON). Client side library that binds data on DOM level, so it integrates nicely with good old JavaScript, WebComponents, or Angular.

Implements [Server communication](https://github.com/Starcounter-Jack/PuppetJs/wiki/Server-communication).

### Installation

You can install it using [bower](http://bower.io/) `bower install PuppetJs` or just download from [github](https://github.com/PuppetJs/PuppetJs).

Then add source to your head:

```html
<!-- include PuppetJs + PuppetDOM with dependencies -->
<script src="bower_components/fast-json-patch/src/json-patch-duplex.js"></script>
<script src="bower_components/PuppetJs/src/puppet.js"></script>
<script src="bower_components/PuppetJs/src/puppet-dom.js"></script>
```

### Usage

After DOM is ready, initialize with the constructor:

```javascript
/**
 * Defines a connection to a remote PATCH server, gives an object that is persistent between browser and server
 */
var puppet = new PuppetDOM();
```
Now click, blur, pop/pushstate events may trigger a HTTP PATCH request.

### Demo

[Example with Polymer's Template Binding and Web Components](http://puppetjs.github.io/PuppetJs/lab/polymer/index.html)

### Options (Constructor parameters)
All the parameters are optional.
```javascript
var puppet = new Puppet({attribute: value});
```

Attribute           | Type          | Default                | Description
---                 | ---           | ---                    | ---
`listenTo`          | *HTMLElement* | `document.body`        | DOM node, that indicates a root of subtree to listen to events.

most of them are accessible also in runtime:

#### Properties

```javascript
puppet.property
```
Property   | Type          | Default         | Description
---         | ---           | ---             | ---
`element`   | *HTMLElement* | `document.body` | See `listenTo` above
`listening` | *Boolean*     | `true`          | Is listening on

#### Methods

```javascript
puppet.method()
```
Attribute   | Type          | Description
---         | ---           | ---
`unlisten`  | *HTMLElement* | Stop listening to DOM events
`listen`    | *HTMLElement* | Start listening to DOM events

### Sending client changes to server

PuppetJs detects changes to the observed object in real time. However, change patches are
queued and not sent to the server until a `blur` event occurs. It is because normally there is no business need to save
a partially filled field and in many cases it may be harmful to data integrity. Another benefit is performance
 improvement due to reduced number of requests.

To force sending changes on each key stroke (for example to implement live search), you can configure it
per input field (given that this field is bound to observed object):

```html
<input update-on="blur"><!-- default behavior: update server on blur -->
<input update-on="input"><!-- update server on key stroke -->
```

### Browser history

PuppetJs uses the HTML5 history API to update the URL in the browser address bar to reflect the new page. It also listens to a `popstate` event so it could ask the server for new JSON-Patch to morph the page back to previous state. Due to lack of native `pushstate` event you need to either:
 * call `puppet.changeState(url)` after your `history.pushState(url)`, 
 * call `puppet.morph(url)` - that will call `pushState` and update puppet's state for you, 
 * trigger `puppet-redirect-pushstate` with `{url: "/new/url"}` on `window` after your `history.pushState(url)`, 
 * or use [`<puppet-redirect>`](https://github.com/PuppetJs/puppet-redirect) Custom Element that does it for you.

### Development

In order to minify it locally you'll need a basic setup.

* Install [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/):

    ```sh
    $ [sudo] npm install -g grunt-cli
    ```

* Install local dependencies:

    ```sh
    $ npm install
    ```

* To minify project.
